1,2,1, We know climate-related changes on our planet cause extreme weather.,
1,2,2, And extreme weather has life-changing effects.,
1,2,2, We see this in the rise of weather-related disasters around the globe.,
1,2,0, But there’s one aspect of this topic we don’t hear much about: How does climate change affect our health?,
0,2,2," Well, as temperatures rise, record-setting heat waves become more frequent.",
0,2,2, They can lead to heat-related illnesses and dangerous cardiovascular issues.,
1,2,2, Rising sea levels and unpredictable weather mean More super storms and flooding.,
1,2,2, Wildfires and droughts.,
0,2,2," Injuries, property damage – even homelessness and loss of loved ones.",
0,2,2, Super storms also expand habitats where insects thrive and multiply.,
1,2,2, Mosquitos and other bugs can spread diseases – like malaria and West Nile virus.,
1,2,2," As the earth’s carbon dioxide levels increase … Air quality declines, causing respiratory issues, like asthma and lung cancer.",
1,2,2, Bouts of Salmonella rise.,
1,2,2, Bacteria in water contaminates seafood and shellfish.,
1,2,2, And we see a surge in gastrointestinal illnesses and bloodstream infections.,
1,2,2," With all of this, we’re looking at serious grief and emotional trauma.",
1,2,1," But … there’s hope. The good news is -- we can make a difference, but we must act now!",
0,0,1, What can you do? Take action!,
0,1,1, Unplug devices and chargers when not in use to reduce your energy consumption.,
0,2,1," Walk, bike or use other means of active transportation.",
0,1,1, Get your food locally. Buy only the food you require – and give edible leftovers to those in need.,
0,2,1," At the city, state and national levels: Stay informed.",
0,2,1, Let your elected representatives know what you think.,
0,2,1," At Kaiser Permanente, we are developing real-world strategies that address climate change",
1,2,1, to support your health and the health of our communities.,

1,2,2, Many of the predicted impacts of climate change on the planet are bad if not catastrophic.,
1,2,2, Melting glaciers. Rising sea levels. More extreme weather.,
0,0,0, But what about the effect on diseases spread by mosquitoes?,
1,1,0, Will malaria become more common too? Scientific efforts to find out have thus far been over-simplified and the results mixed.,
1,1,0, Now using a sophisticated model incorporating hydrology researchers say that while malaria may increase in some parts of the world it probably won't in West Africa.,
1,1,0, Now using a sophisticated model incorporating hydrology researchers say that while malaria may increase in some parts of the world it probably won't in West Africa.,
0,2,0, Their models predict that the number of malaria cases there will largely remain the same and in some places even decrease.,
1,2,2, Because malaria is a disease of temperature-sensitive parasites spread by climate-sensitive mosquitoes.,
1,2,2, Environmental change can potentially shift the malaria burden up or down.,
1,2,2,For example the malaria-transmitting mosquitoes in Africa prefer temperatures in the 60s to mid-80s.,
1,2,0,They’ll die if it drops below 50 or goes above 95.,
1,1,2, Temperatures also influence the incubation period of the Plasmodium parasite.,
1,2,2, Plus because mosquitoes reproduce in standing pools of water rainfall can also have a huge impact.,
1,2,2, But the link between rainfall and malaria is more complicated than a simple one-to-one relationship.,
1,2,2, But the link between rainfall and malaria is more complicated than a simple one-to-one relationship.,
0,1,2, In West Africa where more people are infected with and die from the disease than anywhere else in the world.,
1,2,0, The number and size of rainwater pools depends on rainfall patterns as well as local soil vegetation and topography.,
1,1,0, Scientists spent several years doing fieldwork in two villages in Niger to collect information about soil moisture water temperature pool location and depth and how mosquitoes interact with these pools. ,

1,2,0, The scientists then used this model to predict whether malaria outbreaks will become more common or more severe in the future.,
0,2,2, With climate change the western part of West Africa is expected to get drier.,
0,2,2, In the east it will likely get wetter. In all places the temperatures will rise significantly.,
1,2,0, So what does the model say? In northern West Africa it’s hot and dry.,
1,2,2, Although the region will see more rain it won’t be enough to allow mosquitoes to prosper.,
1,2,1, So climate change is unlikely to impact the number of malaria cases there.,
1,2,2, Similarly in the south temperatures will rise -- but not so much that they put a damper on mosquitoes.,
1,2,2, Malaria is rampant there now and will continue to be. ,
1,2,1, Far western Africa however will see less rainfall and increased temperature according.,
1,2,2, Both changes work to hinder the spread of the disease. And because the region is usually near the threshold for a malaria outbreak.,
1,2,2, Residents of these villages can expect fewer and less serious outbreaks. ,
1,2,2, Finally eastern areas are expected to have more rainfall augmenting breeding. ,
1,2,1, At the same time higher temperatures will likely kill more mosquitoes. ,
1,2,0, Here the two effects cancel out suggesting that the current rate of malaria will remain the same despite changes to the environment. ,
1,1,2, The results highlight the importance of building models with additional details based on careful fieldwork and indicate that while many West Africans will undoubtedly suffer from higher temperatures in the coming years.,

1,2,2,but the ice fjord is threatened by the warming world these years ,
1,2,2,the ice front has retreated especially from 2003 and until now,
1,2,2,so it is not floating on water but is situated on the rocks in the bottom of the Fjord ,
1,2,0,the reason for the retreat is not simple but one of the reasons is the warm water from the Gulf Stream,

1,2,2, Three out of four adults in America say that global warming is affecting weather in the United States. ,

1,0,0, But what does the science say?,
0,2,0, Is global warming changing weather patterns and weather extremes?,
1,2,0, First let’s consider some basic facts about weather and climate.,
0,2,1, Earth is a water planet.,
1,2,0, Oceans and lakes cover three quarters of the Earth’s surface as depicted in this pie chart. ,
0,2,1, Water is the only substance on Earth that exists naturally as a solid liquid and gas.,
0,2,0, The gas phase of water is referred to as water vapor.,
1,2,0, Did you know that water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas in Earth’s atmosphere?,
1,2,0, While we can’t see water vapor in the atmosphere instruments on satellites can.,

1,2,2, Watch as storms in the mid-latitudes draw the warm moisture from the tropics.,
1,2,1, Weather patterns help redistribute heat and moisture around the planet.,
1,2,2, This means that the availability of water vapor fuels or limits all atmospheric processes.,
0,2,2, Let’s take a closer look at how water vapor fuels tropical cyclones also called hurricanes and typhoons.,
1,2,2, Let’s take a closer look at how water vapor fuels tropical cyclones also called hurricanes and typhoons.,
1,2,2, Rising air over warm ocean waters carries water vapor upward into colder air.,
1,2,2, As this happens warm moist air near the surface rushes in to take its place creating the strong winds associated with hurricanes.,
1,2,2, As this happens warm moist air near the surface rushes in to take its place creating the strong winds associated with hurricanes.,
1,2,2, As the warm air rises the water vapor cools and condenses into clouds releasing heat.,
1,2,2, The added heat accelerates this process.,
1,2,2, The rotating Earth causes the storm to begin spinning.,
1,2,2, Once a storm moves over land it weakens rapidly largely because the storm lacks the moisture and heat the ocean provided.,
1,2,2, Once a storm moves over land it weakens rapidly largely because the storm lacks the moisture and heat the ocean provided.,

1,2,2, In a warming world with warmer oceans there is more evaporation and fuel for storms leading to more powerful storms.,
0,2,2, The warmer air can also hold more moisture meaning heavier rainfall.,
1,2,2, Finally rising sea levels mean higher storm surges and more flooding.,
1,2,2, Basic science points to bigger storms changing weather patterns and more extremes.,
0,0,0, What does this mean for you?,
1,2,2, If you live near the coast like a lot of people there is an increased vulnerability to storms due to rising sea levels. ,
