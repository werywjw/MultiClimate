        "[IDEFICS](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceM4/idefics-80b) is a multi-modal model based on the [Flamingo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14198) architecture. It can take images and texts as input and return text outputs but it does not support image generation. \\\\\n",
        "IDEFICS is built on top of two unimodal open-access pre-trained models to connect the two modalities. Newly initialized parameters in the form of Transformer blocks bridge the gap between the vision encoder and the language model. The model is trained on a mixture of image/text pairs and unstrucutred multimodal web documents. \\\\\n",
        "The [finetuned versions](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceM4/idefics-80b-instruct) of IDEFICS behave like LLM chatbots while also understanding visual input. \\\\\n",

            "and that results in basically three things \n",
            "first more heat which is what we call like individual molecules moving faster which is wild \n",
            "like when you are hot it is because the molecules that make up your body are jiggling more doesn't seem real but it is\n",
            "second you have more severe weather which is when a lot of molecules together move around more \n",
            "and because of those two you have number three which is probably the worst of them \n",
            "things are different that doesn't sound so bad except that we have built a tremendous amount of our human infrastructure designed based on the idea that things will be roughly the same now as they were in the past with regards to rainfall and temperature and stuff like that \n",

            "people might use their air conditioners way more than in the past so entire power grids fail \n",
            "or forests that grew in areas that once had shorter dry seasons might burn up in fires\n",
            "so that's bad and always the first thing you should ask when something bad is happening is why is that happening\n",
            "well you know when you go outside wearing a black t-shirt you get hotter faster than if you're wearing a white t-shirt \n",
            "that's because things only look black if they absorb all of the visible light that is hitting them\n",
            "if the light was not being absorbed it would either be reflected as white light or as a mirror or it would be clear which would be a strange choice for a shirt \n",

            "the light no longer exists the energy is now movement\n",
            "and that movement can be transferred to other molecules just like a cue ball hitting a pool ball \n",
            "there are basically two ways a molecule can heat up and we just talked about both of them\n",
            "the first is that a photon travels through space and then gets absorbed by a molecule and speeds up that molecule that's heat from radiation \n",
            "and the second way is that a particle that's jiggling a lot hits a particle that's jiggling less and transfers its heat to that other molecule\n",
            "when that happens in a solid we call it conduction when it happens in a fluid we call it convection \n",
            "so like when you're in the shade 99 of the heat you are feeling is from convection it's molecules in the air running into you and transferring their heat to you \n",
            "but when you're in the sun it's a mix of both the radiation and the convection which is why it's hotter in the sun \n",

            "and when we put more of them in the atmosphere our atmosphere is a little less clear in those wavelengths and it's a little more black \n",
            "those molecules absorb photons they start to move around faster they knock into other molecules which also start to move around faster they push on each other more and more until they have lower pressure and that hot air starts to rise\n",
