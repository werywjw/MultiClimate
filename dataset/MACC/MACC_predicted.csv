0,[Music] in the field of migration we stand,0
1,before an historical opportunity first of all to negotiate a global compact on,1
2,migration first time this has ever occurred but we also have the,1
1,opportunity to integrate climate change concerns as a driver of forced migration,1
1,into the global compact we've been working on climate change for 20 years,1

2,people can share the feeling of urgency,1
0,the majority of the moment are happening,0
