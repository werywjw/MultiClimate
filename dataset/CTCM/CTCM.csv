0, Capturing and transforming CO2 to mitigate climate change
1, We need to address renewable energy we need to look at transportation we need to look at agriculture.
0, [Music]
1, We'll have new materials that better enable us to capture carbon more efficiently.
1, At ibm research we're using ai and machine learning technologies to help us accelerate the way that we discover and learn about new materials and try and reduce the amount of co2 that we're actually releasing into the atmosphere.

1, We're looking at sorbent materials which are usually liquids where you have the flue gases actually bubbling through it.
1, And it's absorbing the co2.
1, And then we're also looking at membranes which actually can filter it out.
1, There's a huge opportunity to capture the amount of carbon dioxide that's coming out of power plant flu stacks.
1, Carbon dioxide once it's been captured has a couple different destinations.
1, We can use it to create plastics or other polymers that have a lot of value.
