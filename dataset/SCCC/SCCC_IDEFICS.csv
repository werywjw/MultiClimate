2,emissions which are driven argely by the burning of fossil fuels have increased on average by two percent per year,1
2,on the current trajectory temperatures will rise four to five degrees celsius by the end of the century,1
1,science tells us that to avoid the worst impacts we need to keep global average warming well below two degrees,1
1,to do this we need to cut emissions in half in the next decade and get to net zero emissions by 2050,1

1,and fourth mixed reality we are now at a time where there is emerging of real and virtual worlds ,0
1,this mixed reality is shifting how we engage with each other and the world around us ,1
1,together these four disruptors are already shifting current power dynamics norms and values,1
0,but how do we steer these disruptors toward the path we want?,1
0,no one knows where these digital disruptors will leave,0
2,so far the digital age has contributed to unsustainable production and consumption patterns as well as increasing inequities around the world,1
