2,we are in the midst of a climate crisis ,1
2,five sectors account for over 80% of the global emissions of greenhouse gases transport electricity industry land and food sectors,1

2,emissions which are driven argely by the burning of fossil fuels have increased on average by two percent per year,1
2,on the current trajectory temperatures will rise four to five degrees Celsius by the end of the century,2
1,science tells us that to avoid the worst impacts we need to keep global average warming well below two degrees,1
1,to do this we need to cut emissions in half in the next decade and get to Net Zero emissions by 2050,1

2,but emissions continue to rise this is because underpinning the high emitting sectors our social and economic systems that reinforce our carbon intensive society ,2

1,and fourth mixed reality we are now at a time where there is emerging of real and virtual worlds ,0
1,this mixed reality is shifting how we engage with each other and the world around us ,0
1,together these four disruptors are already shifting current power dynamics norms and values,0
0,but how do we steer these disruptors toward the path we want?,2
0,no one knows where these digital disruptors will leave,0
2,so far the digital age has contributed to unsustainable production and consumption patterns as well as increasing inequities around the world,1

1,it is time to leverage these disruptions to drive the change we want to see,1
1,this will take researchers innovators policymakers and citizens working together around the world,1
1,future earth sustainability in the digital age initiative is building these collaborations and defining an agenda for action,1
