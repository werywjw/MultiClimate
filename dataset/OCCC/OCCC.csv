0,Overview of the C-ROADS Climate Change Policy Simulator
0,[Music]
0,the c-roads climate change policy simulator is a free simulation model developed by our team at climate interactive and MIT Sloan's sustainability initiative

1,it is used to demonstrate how climate actions from countries or regions would affect future outcomes such as temperature change and is often paired with our role-playing exercise the world climate simulation

0,here we have the main c roads interface currently being viewed in six region mode 
0,to change modes click on the simulation button to choose global mode or three region mode
0,and the model will automatically re-aggregate 
0,as our default graphs we have greenhouse gas net emissions by region and temperature change both from the years 2000 to 2100.

0,these graphs can be changed by clicking on the graph title or in the graphs menu
0,to return to the default graphs simply click on return to default graphs or the home button

0,at the bottom here we have the input table where users can enter values and watch the model calculate their impacts in real time 
0,there are five inputs for each country or region 
0,the first is emissions Peak year which determines the year in which non-land use greenhouse gas emissions will stop increasing in that country or region 
0,the first is emissions Peak year which determines the year in which non-land use greenhouse gas emissions will stop increasing in that country or region 
1,next you can decide whether to reduce those emissions and at what annual rate 
1,finally the last two inputs are based on what level of action the country or region would like to put towards preventing deforestation and promoting A4 station

0,as you enter in an input notice how the graphs and temperature change accordingly 
0,in addition to these inputs users also have the option to change some of the underlying model assumptions under the simulation menu assumptions

0,to reset policies assumptions or both you can find reset Options under the simulation menu as well as this button right here 
0,there are also several other features to explore in the menu bar 
0,c roads is available in several different languages accessible through this menu item here 
0,there are also a few additional viewing Options under the view menu and many supporting resources Under The Help menu

0,these three buttons allow you to undo redo and replay an action 
0,you can also view c roads in full screen and click here for any additional guidance that you may need

0,you also have the ability to share whatever scenario you create in cereals with others 
0,you can share your scenario on social media via email or simply copy the scenario link 
1,we encourage everyone to register their use of C roads so that we can gain knowledge on who is using our tools and offer the most tailored support we can
