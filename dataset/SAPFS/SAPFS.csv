0,livestock accounts for almost 10 to 44 percent anywhere between 10 to 44 percent for the continents agriculture gdp

2,so in africa pastoral generates 75 percent of the continent's milk and more than half of its meat and this despite the fact that current climate-related struggles

2,as a matter of fact currently about 20 million pastoralists have been struggling with the drought ongoing drought as a result of two years of failed rains

1,but when there is a good year pastoralists ensure both food and nutritional security 
2,and actually there has been proof to show that the children in poor pastoralist household actually suffer from low levels of malnutrition as compared to children in poor crop farm households

1,if it is well managed and supported pastoralists is one of the most viable but and potentially sustainable systems to help dryland communities cope with climate change in addition to being one of the most efficient ways to produce food in marginal lands

0,How can pastoralist value chains advance Africa's food system transformation
0,pastoralists are actually natural stewards of the rangeland systems 
1,so if well managed pastoralism in fact becomes sustainable 
2,so what has been missing are targeted financial investments and market interventions to help them tap their survival skills which have been built over generations and also increase their income to deal with this climate stress and to get more outputs from their animals

1,until recently drought emergencies have largely been met with provisions of food aid along with some basic social protection programs 
1,however to help close this gap ilre developed an index insurance program for the never insured pastoralists of kenya and ethiopia

0,these index livestock insurance policies are purchased by pastoralists or their governments on their behalf 
2,the insurance payouts are made to the herders when drought conditions become severe 
2,and there is no forage available 
1,these payouts are supposed to help pastoralists buy food for the families fodder and veterinary services for their animals in addition to helping them to meet any other kind of livelihood needs

0,How can social norms be modified to create greater opportunities for pastoralist women
0,interestingly what most people don't realize that out of our privately purchased insurance policy holders 43 percent of them are women

1,we have conducted studies particularly to understand the decision-making dynamics in the pastoral households to understand the opportunities to further engage women and help them access markets and financial services

0,How can pastoral systems raise their contributions to Africa's food systems in the face of climate change
1,it is time that financial solutions such as ibly be embedded into the anticipatory and emergency response programs of the governments 
1,government should be at the forefront of these efforts with support of course from the private sector and with dedicated climate financing 
1,better quality and near real-time data on indicators such as nutrition market prices and grazing conditions will both improve these programs and attract market players

1,with government and the private sector acting together we will be able to build upon the traditional coping strategies of the pastoralists and avoid the worst effects of climate change
