2,we have seen it all more and more extreme weather events endangered species fighting for their existence people losing their traditional way of life and our forests and peat lands disappearing

2,the UN estimates that since 1990 forests globally have decreased by 300 million hectares

2,and this destruction has led to a major calamity 
2,the release of huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change
2,with the third largest forested area in the world Indonesia's forests and agriculture are believed to account for the majority of its greenhouse gas emissions

1,despite this Indonesia has pledged to cut emissions by 29 percent below business-as-usual levels by 2030

2,However greenhouse gas emissions have traditionally been difficult to quantify especially those released from agriculture forestry and other land uses in a country as large and diverse as Indonesia

1,so developing new technologies to measure emissions is going to be vital in the fight against climate change

0,the incus is a big data platform for monitoring net greenhouse gas emissions in the land sector
0,it uses a combination of the best available satellite and ground-based forestry data taken from across the entire country

0,the difference between the two shows the total amount of greenhouse gas emitted by the land-based sectors in Indonesia 
0,these results are then sent to emissions reporting authorities 
1,the information can then be used to meet international reporting requirements and support informed decision making on how best to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and more sustainably manage Indonesia's landscapes

1,and as incus develops and grows so of a vital greenhouse gas data needed by Indonesia to implement policies that will preserve its forests and meet its goals to reduce house gas emissions
