2, Global warming is happening one observable is the shrinking optic sea ice in 2017.
2, Global warming is happening one observable is the shrinking optic sea ice in 2017.
1, The optic sea ice area is 40 less than that was in 1980.
1, The optic sea ice area is 40 less than that was in 1980.
2, The global warming is caused by the greenhouse effect.
2, The global warming is caused by the greenhouse effect.
0, Energy comes from the sun when sunlight hit the earth.
2, Some is refracted back to the space.
2, And some is trapped by the atmosphere which keep the earth warm.
2, However the shop increase of the greenhouse gas is overheating us.
2, 76 percent of the greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide and 16 is Method.
2, 76 percent of the greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide and 16 is Method.
2, Although methane is much less than carbon dioxide is 25 times more efficient in chopping the Heat.
2, Medicine have been increasing since 1980 and keep hitting new highs in recent years.
2, The main objective of this measurement is to investigate the methane emission rate of the sowing soil.

0, This is our instrument the ultra portable greenhouse gas analyzer from Los Gatos research.
0, The left side panel includes gas Inlet Port gas exhaust ports.
1, The right side panel includes many different data interference ports.
1, It has a built-in computer and you only need to connect a monitor and the mouse.
1, It uses a cavity enhanced laser absorption spectrometry to measure the gas concentration.
1, This instrument has very high sensitivity this is what happens when our Excel air to the tube connected to the inlet Port.
1, The carbon dioxide and water vapor increase dramatically.
1, This is the Frozen Douglas Lake near the University of Michigan Biological Station.
0, The forest and ground are covered by a thick layer of snow.
0, I dig a hole in the snow and put our self-made chamber on the ground.
0, Then two tubes are used to connect the chamber to the inlet and exhaust ports of the instrument to form a closed system.
0, We have three measurement sites located at different latitude and similar longitude including University of Michigan Ann Arbor University Michigan Biological Station at Palestine and Wawa of Ontario Canada.
0, We have three measurement sites located at different latitude and similar longitude including University of Michigan Ann Arbor University Michigan Biological Station at Palestine and Wawa of Ontario Canada.

0, Now let's look into the measuremented data.
0, Does the concentration of medicine emitted from soil for three days from February 4th to 6th at um Biological Station.
0, Does the concentration of medicine emitted from soil for three days from February 4th to 6th at um Biological Station.
2, The red line shows the temperature you can see there is a time lag between the methane concentration and temperature.
2, It is because most molecules need time to generate and release from soil.
2, Generally the higher temperature the higher medicine concentration released from soil.
0, We also measure the carbon dioxide and Vapor concentration.
1, We observed that they also have a strong relation with temperature.
0, Next We compare two adjacent days with similar temperature but there was snow on the second day.
0, Next We compare two adjacent days with similar temperature but there was snow on the second day.
1, Interestingly the medicine concentration decreases when there is snow while the carbon dioxide concentration increases.
1, Missing many comes from the soil and the snow cover decreases the emission from the soil.
1, In comparison carbon dioxide can mostly be controlled by the trees in the rural area.

0, Snow Cavalry reflects the sunlight and decreases the photosynthesis.
2, Less carbon dioxide is absorbed unless the carbon dioxide concentration increases.
0, Finally We compare the Amendments as three different locations.
2, However umbs and Wawa there are the different latitude with about same longitude.
2, There are about three degrees increase in latitude for each location from south to North.
2, The values are average over one day.
2, The temperature is lowest at Wawa the average Mason image is lowest at umpps.
2, The average carbon dioxide emission is highest at umps.
2, The average water vapor emission decreases as the latitude increases.
2, In summary there is no obvious dependence on latitude for methane and carbon dioxide emissions according to this one day average.
2, In summary there is no obvious dependence on latitude for methane and carbon dioxide emissions according to this one day average.
0, More data needed for analysis.
2, According to other resources methane concentration slightly increases with latitude while carbon dioxide concentration doesn't have obvious dependence on latitude.
0, Here is a brief summary essential measurements are conducted at three different sites.
0, You are my number your biologic station Palestine and Wawa Canada.
0, It demonstrates an obvious time lag between the methane concentration and the air temperature.
0, It demonstrates an obvious time lag between the methane concentration and the air temperature.
1, Methane decreases dramatically when it snows.
1, To investigate methane's dependence on latitude there are too many environmental variations we need more continuous measurements using a uniform calibration process to minimize their impacts.

1, Remote sensing Technologies can provide continuous large-scale measurements and are important for monitoring adaption and mitigation of Earth's climate and Global changes.
