1,1,How Solar Panels Work To Reduce Climate Change
1,1,goal 13 of the sustainable development goals 
1,1,climate action explaining how solar panels work and how they contribute to reducing climate change
0,1,electricity has become a necessity for human life 
1,1,we use it to power everything from our homes to our streetlights to our jobs 
2,2,although we need it in order to generate electricity we end up putting a lot of harmful chemicals into the air through burning fossil fuels

2,2,natural gases and coals are emitting toxic evels of carbon into our atmosphere that contribute to global warming
2,2,climate change is a global issue that negatively affects us all 
2,2,it can lead to stronger natural disasters such as droughts and hurricanes make the air we breathe deadly and caused the economy to lose millions of dollars

2,2,not only are they dangerous but fossil fuels are a limited resource 
2,2,once they're gone there's no way of getting them back and we'll be left in the dark 
1,1,the good news is there's a safer form of energy out there and that's been supplying us power for as long as we can remember
1,1,to put it simply this energy comes from the Sun 
1,1,specifically solar panels harness energy from the Sun and converts it into electricity in order to power homes and businesses
1,1,they do this by exciting electrons and silicon cells using the photons of light from the Sun

1,1,most of the time these panels are placed on the roof in order to get as much exposure to the Sun as possible
1,1,solar panels contribute to reducing climate change by reducing air pollution caused by utility companies
1,1,using solar power creates be clothe generating capacity which saves utilities from using polluting supplemental systems during times when demands for energy are high

1,1,using solar power creates be clothe generating capacity which saves utilities from using polluting supplemental systems during times when demands for energy are high
1,1,the more solar electric power systems in a general area the less capacity a utility needs to build
1,1,this ultimately saves money creates jobs and gives the area clean green source of energy
1,1,solar energy is a resource that's been fueling the planet for centuries
1,1,now we can use it to power our home and help keep the plan of clean and safe
