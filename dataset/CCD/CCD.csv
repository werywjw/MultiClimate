0, The victims will be Southern countries and they are facing a maor major problem how to adjust to the climate change.
2, As most countries think that the way their economies and lives adapt to climate change is the priority much more than the reduction of greenhouse effect gas emissions.

0, Ao why is this problem vital for southern?
2, Countries because thanks to the last ipcc report we know that the the whole planet has embarked on a pathway which is absolutely catastrophic.
