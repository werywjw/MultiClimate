0,how am i going to react to that same with firms
1,and the key to climate change i think is largely going to be at the organizational level 
1,individuals matter
0,but how we generate power whether we build roads versus transit what kind of cars we build how we build them these are all firm level decisions

0,my mantra you know on homeowners with smart thermostats
