0,NASA's Climate Advisor Discusses Climate Change
1,My name is Dr. Gavin Schmidt and I'm NASA's Senior Climate Advisor which means I bring NASA's climate science to the public and help figure out how to apply it to saving the planet

0,I've been a climate scientist with NASA for more than 25 years  and I use Earth data and models to understand the past present and future of climate change

2,Climate change is one of the most complex issues facing us today
2,It is a global problem felt on local scales and one that will be around for decades and centuries to come.
1,Just as your doctor checks your health by monitoring your temperature and other vital signs at NASA we keep an eye on the planet's vital signs.

0,We keep track of the Earth's temperature the patterns of rainfall ice sheets sea level rise and the amount of carbon dioxide in our air.

1,Thanks to NASA Earth Science we know our planet and its climate are changing and based on the evidence from the oceans to the upper atmosphere and from the tropics to the poles we also know human activities are driving this change.

2,As our planet's temperature rises that will impact weather and extremes
2,This means more severe heat waves more intense droughts wildfires and hurricane seasons.
2,Many extreme events in recent years have been made worse by human-caused climate change.
1,I look forward to helping decision makers at all levels find and use the information they need to move towards a more climate secure future
