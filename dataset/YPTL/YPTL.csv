2,an all-time high in their understanding that it's mostly human-caused at 68 percent of Americans
2,and then perhaps most importantly we see an all-time record high of worry about climate change

0,and that really falls out into two main interesting groups 
2,one among Democrats Democrats actually had already believed that climate change was happening in human-caused and worried about it
0,but for them they've also really increased their sense that this is a high national priority for the President and for Congress

1,it's an issue of faith and morality it calls the deepest questions about who we are as human beings  
0,how we treat one another and how we treat this planet that we live on 
0,and for those who believe what's the proper relation between us and the divine
