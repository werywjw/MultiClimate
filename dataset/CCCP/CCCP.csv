0, Combating climate change in the Pacific
1, Climate change presents a genuinely existential threat there is no more important problem.
1, Island nation states like Kiribati they're very exposed to climate change risks.
2, And for them that's not just a loss of property it's the loss of culture as the loss of identity with dramatically change Earth's climate as a result of greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels for energy and also deforestation.

2, And we're also seeing profound changes in the ocean chemistry.
0, And an ocean sea levels climate change will impact the biodiversity in our oceans in ways that we really don't fully understand yet because we're facing an uncertain future.

0, So in addition to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.
0, We also now have to think about how we're going to adapt.
0, So eco that project is looking at adaptation options for communities living in the coastal zone in small island developing States in the Pacific.

1, Climate change will affect people across many islands in the Pacific by changing the conditions that they have come to expect.
1, It's affecting coastal inundation.
0, It's affecting the coral reefs and its ability to provide food for people.
0, We start with the focus on understanding their relationship with natural systems.
0, And then we try and make sure that anything that we recommend as an appropriate balance between what that community needs and what's needed to sustain the natural environment around them.
1, I like to say climate changes become everyone's business our research is remarkable in our attempt to have a genuinely integrated multidisciplinary approach.

0, We need micro economists we need coastal engineers we need our marine ecologists we need planners.
1, We need social scientists to gain a holistic understanding of the problem and the possible solutions.

1, What inspires me about working on the Eco debt project is the ability to work with other experts and see how this whole system might face challenges due to climate change.

2, Well unfortunately it's a growth business but it's not too late because the root cause are these greenhouse gas emissions and it's well within our bill stop them.
