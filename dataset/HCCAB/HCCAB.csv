0,how climate change affects biodiversity 
2,as the Earth's conditions have changed ecosystems and species either adapted or died off 
2,most species haven't had time to adapt to climate change 
2,increasing temperatures in damp natural disasters growing in frequency are prime examples of how climate change is disrupting the natural balance

2,humans are directly harmed because of climate changes negative effect on biodiversity 
2,this includes loss of water sources and damp a higher rate of difficulty when obtaining certain medicines due to the continued damage to the plants they are made from

2,the Millennium ecosystem assessment which studies human impact on the environment states that climate change is likely to become one of the most significant drivers of biodiversity lost by the end of the century

1,just like us plants and damp animals need the world to be hospitable
1,if we can do our part to help them they can help us too
1,restoring habitats can remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere 
1,this will help reduce climate change by removing all the access carbon stored in the atmosphere
1,also conserving intact ecosystems such as mangroves can help reduce the disasters impacts of climate change such as flooding and damp storm surges

1,we can also do our part to fight climate change by burning less fossil fuels by driving less and damp lowering our intake of processed food

1,humans plants and damp animals must share this world
1,by working together we can make sure it will be a safe place to live for generations to come
