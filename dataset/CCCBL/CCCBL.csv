0, Can climate change and biodiversity loss be tackled together?	
2, There is no way they can be tackled in silos.
2, Otherwise climate global warming will continue by diversity loss will continue.

1, And the recent years have clearly demonstrated that climate change and laws of biodiversity are intrinsically connected.

1, And because they are connected so and solutions to climate change.
1, Climate change is looking at nature-based solutions for climate change.
1, So it means biodiversity is providing solutions for climate change and therefore you cannot deal with climate change without nature and we cannot deal with nature biodiversity without climate change.

1, 30 percent of climate mitigation and adaptation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will come from biodiversity nature.

0, When we look at 23 percent of human greenhouse gas emissions comes from agriculture fisheries uh forest.

1, So clearly unless biodiversity plays its role.
2, Climate change side side will be stuck.
2, And unless climate change plays its role then biodiversity loss will continue.
2, So both need to be looked at as one common challenge.
2, And that's why we are saying the world is facing triple crisis climate change loss of biodiversity and pollution.
