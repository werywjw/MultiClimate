2, Of all industrial carbon dioxide emitted since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century.,0
1, more than half has been released since 1988.,1
1, — the same year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change began its work.,1
2," As greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere, they trap heat.",1
2, This is causing a long-term increase in global average temperatures – a phenomenon called global warming.,1
1, Earth’s systems regulate the climate through carbon sinks that absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. ,0
1," The most critical carbon sinks are oceans, soil, and plant life.",1
2, Oceans are the largest carbon sink on the planet.,0
1, They currently absorb thirty percent of the carbon we emit and ninety percent of the excess heat generated by increased greenhouse gas emissions.,1
1, They currently absorb thirty percent of the carbon we emit and ninety percent of the excess heat generated by increased greenhouse gas emissions.,1
2, But the oceans cannot continue to absorb heat and carbon emissions without consequences.,1
2," As oceans absorb carbon dioxide, the acidity of the water increases.",1
2, Ocean acidification poses a serious threat to ocean coral and other sea life. Vast amounts of carbon dioxide and methane are also stored in frozen deposits in the ocean floor called gas hydrates.,1

2, The gases in these hydrates are precariously close to being released because of rising ocean temperatures.,1
2," If so, instead of acting as a carbon sink, oceans will become carbon emitters, with grave consequences for climate change.",1
