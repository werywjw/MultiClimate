1, The reason why understanding the implications of climate change and variability on crop production is important is because we know that crops are sensitive to climate.
1, The reason why understanding the implications of climate change and variability on crop production is important is because we know that crops are sensitive to climate.
1, We know that we can only grow certain crops in certain environments.
1, Because they have certain water requirements or certain temperature or sunlight requirements.
1, And when those requirements actually change then the productivity of that particular crop or its the quality of the of the fruit or the the tubers or other things that are produced by that crop can be detrimentally impacted.

1, So we need to understand what the impacts are on growth.
2, We we also need to understand what the sensitivities of those crops are to specific changes particularly changes in extremes.
0, And so there is a raft of work that is currently underway that looks at the actual physiology of crops.   
0, So how do crops respond? 
0, There's research that's looking at how farmers can manage crops better in order to maintain productivity.

1, And we're also looking at a range of policy interactions in order to help farmers recover from extreme events when they occur.
