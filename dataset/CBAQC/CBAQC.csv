1, Connections between air quality and climate - English - Sept. 2021
0, [Music] did you know that air pollution and climate change are closely interlinked?
0, This link reveals itself through a series of complex interactions within the atmosphere and between the atmosphere the biosphere and the cryosphere.

2, Air pollutants are gases and small particles called aerosols that have detrimental impacts on human health the environment and the climate.

2, Tropospheric ozone a pollutant forms when volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides react with each other in sunlight.

2, Tropospheric ozone is harmful to human health damages plants and reduces the capacity of ecosystems to absorb carbon dioxide.
2, It also leads to additional heating of the lower atmosphere.
2, Atmospheric aerosols air pollutants that impact the amount of radiation absorbed or reflected by the earth and its atmosphere cause additional heating or cooling of the atmosphere.

2, When these aerosols are deposited on snow and ice they darken their surfaces  resulting in more radiation being absorbed leading to warmer temperatures and melting snow exacerbating climate change climate change in turn impacts air quality.

2, Rising temperatures increase the emission of volatile organic compounds that contribute to the formation of tropospheric ozone and aerosols and worse than existing levels of air pollution.

2, Rises in temperature and changes in precipitation impact the frequency and intensity of wildfires that also contribute to air pollution.

2, As climate change impacts weather patterns it leads to changes in air circulation.
2, As climate change impacts weather patterns it leads to changes in air circulation.
2, More frequent periods where the air remains still stagnated and extreme winds lead to more frequent extreme pollution events.
2, As the world works together to address the challenges posed by air pollution and climate change.
1, It's crucial to understand the linkages between these two phenomena.
1, It's crucial to understand the linkages between these two phenomena.
2, Not all policies will be beneficial for both pollution and climate change but by working together.
1, We can develop an integrated approach that benefits the environment and our sustained life on earth and work towards win-win solutions.
