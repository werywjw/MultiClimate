0, Climate Change and Water Quality
1, Students from the University of New Mexico in collaboration with the students from New Mexico Tech are studying the water chemistry in the same area with Dr crossy as their Mentor.

1, Researchers are sampling for phosphorus and nitrogen as nutrients in the system and comparing pH and dissolved oxygen levels in the hyperic zone of the stream.

0, The hyperic zone as we can see in this diagram is the interface or border between the surface water and the groundwater.
1, This area has the greatest diversity of organisms that will be utilizing nutrients as they weave their way in and out of the surface water and the groundwater.

1, Preliminary results are showing a very tight connection between precipitation events and spikes in both nitrogen and phosphorus in both the groundwater and surface water.
