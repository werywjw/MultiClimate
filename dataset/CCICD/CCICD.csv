2, Climate change is contributing to increased extreme weather events like flooding heat waves and droughts.
2, It is also accelerating the melting of sea ice and glaciers leading to global sea level rise.

2, As a result we are seeing a growing number of climate-related social crises.
2, And the health of the ecosystems upon which humans and all other species depend is deteriorating rapidly.

2, Seasons are shifting in many regions with impacts on the vectors that spread disease.
2, Today 1% of our planet is too hot to support human life.
2, But within the next 50 years almost 20% of the planet could suffer that fate leading to mass migration.
2, By 2050 it is estimated that there will be over 200 million climate refugees.
2, These climate impacts threaten the wellbeing and prosperity of people in countries worldwide including Canada.

2, Canada’s current economy is carbon intensive. 
2, Oil natural gas and coal make up almost 85% of Canada’s primary energy production at a time when many countries are transitioning to net zero economies.
2, Climate impacts in Canada are already estimated to cost billions of dollars each year and will keep rising as climate change accelerates in the years to come.
