2, We know weather is unpredictable.
2, And extreme events have always occurred. We also know these events are becoming more severe and more common.
2, And yes these shifts are down to climate change.
0, So what's the science behind all this?
2, Let's start with greenhouse gases as you probably know these are released when we do things like burn fossil fuels.
2, When this happens heat becomes trapped near the earth's surface making it hotter here on land and in the ocean.

2, Of course this means more evaporation more water vapor in the air and more heavy rainfall.
2, Some places get less some places get more but when it rains it can pour.
2, While all this is going on let's not forget the heat hotter days mean higher fire risk especially in drought prone areas.

2, This extra heat expands the ocean and also melts the polar ice caps ice sheets and glaciers.
2, Sea levels rise increasing the risk of coastal flooding.
2, The dice are now loaded towards more extreme weather and you know what that means for australians.

2, We've lost homes ecosystems livelihoods and loved ones.
2, And the damage is likely to get worse.
0, So what can we do?
1, We need to prepare to live in a world with more intense extreme weather.
